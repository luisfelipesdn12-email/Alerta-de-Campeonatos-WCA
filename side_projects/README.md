Somethings for help me to get constantly informed about the executions

---

## Send me logs:
- Sends a Telegram message with the log of execution;
- I can set it to send me everytime, just when was done or just when was not done.
- [Go to the package](./sendmelog)

## Update gists:
- Update the GitHub gists where I store the `resume.json` and `main.log` of each execution.
- Uses a python script.
- [Go to the package](./update_gists)

## Notify execution information:
- Sends me an toast notification in my PC with:
  - If the execution was or was not done.
  - A button to a resume of the last done execution.
  - A button to the `main.log` gist.
- I can set it to send me everytime, just when was done or just when was not done.
- [Go to the package](./notification)
